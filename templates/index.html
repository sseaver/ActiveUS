          Developed in 2016 by Sam Seaver, ActiveUS was built with Sam's soccer team in mind.
          Way too often, Sam and his team struggled to find a soccer field to play on or other people to play against.
          With this app, teams can schedule events and never struggle to find other players again.

          ActiveUS was designed as a way to bring people together who share a common interest in sports!
          ActiveUS allows users to join events happening in their area, create events that other users can participate in, and communicate with participants/ team members in one simple application.
